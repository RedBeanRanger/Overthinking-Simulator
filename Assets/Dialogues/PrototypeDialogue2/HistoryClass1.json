Class has begun.","\n","^We will be continuing our discussion of the crusades from last time.","\n","^This week, we will be discussing the Crusade of Varna.","\n","^The Crusade of Varna occurred during 1443-1444, prompted by Ottoman expansion into central Europe.","\n","^Much like the other crusades, it was ultimately a failure.","\n","^Before we get into the details, we shall examine the context of the situation.","\n","^In 1443-1444, Europe was in the middle of the Renaissance.","\n","^This was a time of cultural, intellectual, and economic flourishing, and advancement towards modernity.","\n","^This was also a time of moral indifference towards the Ottoman conquest occuring at the eastern European front.","\n","^Prior to the Crusade of Varna, the western powers had failed to defend their eastern territories to such a large degree","\n","^that the Ottoman Sultan, Murad II, was able to bring his Turkish forces all the way into the Balkans.","\n","^Originally, the catholic church had planned for a crusade long before 1443.","\n","^However, the papacy controlling Rome was severely weakened at the time after experiencing the Papal Schism,","\n","^which was a conflict where two popes vied for supremacy.","\n","^Having lost influence in Europe, the papacy had no means to rally the major European powers to participate in crusades.","\n","^So it fell to the eastern European kingdoms, states and free cities to defend themselves, mostly unsuccessfully, from the Ottomans.","\n","^The other major European powers were also too busy being engrossed in their own ventures to participate in crusading.","\n","^In France, Charles the VII and Louis XI were fighting with the dukes of Burgundy for supremacy over France.","\n","^England was teetering on the edge of civil war because of the houses of York and Lancaster.","\n","^Spain and Portugal were busy sailing westward for expansion and discovery.","\n","^Only the Catalan Company of Aragon of the Kingdom of Spain engaged in crusades, as Aragon faced eastward.","\n","^The Holy Roman Empire encompassed hundreds of tiny kingdoms, states, free cities in the Germanies, and was most directly","\n","^affected by the Ottoman threat.","\n","^Yet, the Empire didn't take substantial action to oppose the Ottomans before Sigismund of Luxembourg was crowned emperor.","\n","^The past emperors of the Holy Roman Empire always failed to unite the Empire's feudal leaders together to fight back.","\n","^This was largely because the emperors of the Holy Roman Empire were selected by a committee of feudal leaders within the Empire.","\n","^The committee had incentive to pick weak emperors, as weaker candidates left the feudal lords in the committee with vast amounts","\n","^of power and freedom to do whatever they fancied.","\n","^Sigismund, however, was an exception. He was a man of great vision, and saw need for reforms to the government.","\n","^The Holy Roman Emperor became a force of resistance against the Ottoman invasion.","\n","^Even if partly compelled by geographic location, he did more than his predecessors and his peers in terms of territory defense.","\n","^He founded the Order of the Dragon, a crusading order for select high aristocracy and monarchs.","\n","^A side note, one of the members of the Order of the Dragon was Vlad II, voivode of Wallachia.","\n","^He was dubbed Vlad Dracul in honor of his membership.","\n","^Vlad II, in fact, was a hostage prince raised at King Sigismund's court, in order to keep his country Wallachia, which sat","\n","^at the entry point to Europe for the Ottomans, loyal to the Holy Roman Empire.","\n","^You may be familiar with the name \"Dracula\", meaning \"son of Dracul\", which referred to the sons of Vlad II,","\n","^which included one Vlad III who would be remembered for his monstrous reputation and immortalized in popular conscious.","\n","^Anyway. Despite knowing the importance of holding his borders, King Sigismund could only delay the Turkish advance.","\n","^His crusades were also largely unsuccessful, but at least he attempted them.","\n","^When King Sigismund died in 1437, Sultan Murad II took the opportunity to intensify attacks in the years after.","\n","^Thus, our stage is set for the Crusade of Varna of 1443.","\n","^From these events, we can see the importance of strong governing body in regards to military affairs.","\n","^Truly, you cannot count on other nations to protect your country's borders for you.","\n",{"->":"HistoryClassOutro"},{"#f":1}],"NotPayingAttention":["^Anxious-chan decided not to pay attention.","\n",{"#":"CenterExp:1"},"^Indeed, there are other things you can do in class if you do not pay attention.","\n",{"->":"NotPayingAttentionChoice"},{"#f":1}],"NotPayingAttentionChoice":[[{"#":"CenterExp:0"},"^What would Anxious-chan like to do?","\n","ev","str","^Listen to students in the back gossiping","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-0","flg":20},"ev","str","^Daydream","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-1","flg":20},"ev","str","^Doze off","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-2","flg":20},{"c-0":["\n","^Whispers are abound at the back of the room.
