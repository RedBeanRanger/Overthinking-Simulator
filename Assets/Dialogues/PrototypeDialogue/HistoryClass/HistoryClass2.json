After, he rapidly climbed the military ranks.","\n","^John Hunyadi became the chief authority on all matters anti-Ottoman, but neither he nor the man that he supported","\n","^for election, King Wladyslaw III of Poland, were named Emperor.","\n","^Instead, the title went to Fredrick III of Habsburg, who spent most of his time trying to convince - or deceive - everyone into thinking","\n","^that he was the legitimate King of Hungary, rather than Hunyadi's son Matthias Corvinus.","\n","^...Anyway.","\n","^Pope Eugene IV called for the Crusade of Varna in an attempt to stop Ottoman advancement on January 1st, 1443.","\n","^Aside from John Hunyadi, Wladyslaw III of Poland and Philip the Good of Burgundy participated in leading the campaign.","\n","^Hunyadi's troops of 30,000 men broke through the Sultan's power in Bosnia, Hercegovina, Serbia, Bulgaria, Albania,","\n","^before being forced to retreat from the cold winter frost and lack of supplies.","\n","^Truly, a remarkable and unprecendented success against the Turkish army by the Europeans.","\n","^In fact, it was so remarkable that the Ottoman even agreed to sign a truce treaty with generous terms.","\n","^However, King Wladyslaw III eventually broke the truce at the request of papal legate Cesarini in 1444.","\n","^The Christians wanted to ride the wave of their success, and continue pushing the Ottomans back while morale was high.","\n","^But this sort of optimism led to the final, disastrous battle near Varna in eastern Bulgaria, in November 10, 1444.","\n","^This time, the Christian army was sized at 15,000 men, half of the original number of forces.","\n","^At this point, John Hunyadi makes a special appeal to the voivode of Wallachia, hoping to be assisted.","\n","^Up until now, the voivode of Wallachia, Vlad Dracul, had been ambivalent towards the Crusade due to Ottoman pressure.","\n","^His younger sons, Vlad III and Radu II, were kept in Murad's court as hostages to keep Vlad II from supporting Christian forces.","\n","^Not daring to make rash moves, Vlad Dracul let the bey of Rumelia and his Turkish army enter Wallachia for free access to Transylvania.","\n","^Vlad Dracul did not have much faith in the Christians, but in order to maintain neutrality with the Christians after aiding the Turks,","\n","^he sent his eldest son Mircea II and a small army of 4,000 men to join the Crusade.","\n","^Vlad II knew this choice would be a breach of contract with the Sultan, and would result in the death of his other sons,","\n","^but such was the ruthless world of warfare and politics, where country and power were more important than family.","\n","^Thankfully, the hostage princes were spared, as the Ottoman Sultan saw value in continuing to use them as pawns.","\n","^At the Battle of Varna, John Hunyadi and Wladyslaw III led armies into battle together with Mircea II Dracula.","\n","^...They fought valiantly. But, they were severely underprepared for the far superior size of the Ottoman army that retaliated.","\n","^It was a crushing defeat. King Wladyslaw III made one last desperate attempt to capture the Sultan in the midst of battle.","\n","^He was slain, and the Ottomans displayed his head on a pike.","\n","^Crusaders suffered an enormous loss that they'd never be able to properly recover from.","\n","^Poland would have no king for three years, and the Ottomans had no more major western troops to worry about.","\n","^Ottoman expansion extended to the Peloponnese, and set the stage for Mehmed II, the next Sultan and son of Murad II,","\n","^to conquer Constantinople in 1453.","\n","^As you can see, military affairs have lasting consequences.
